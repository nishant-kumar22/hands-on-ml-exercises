# Hands-On Machine Learning Exercises

A repository dedicated to my solutions and notes for the exercises in Aurélien Géron's "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow." This project serves as a way to track my progress, practice key concepts, and build a portfolio of my work.
